TraduPy

A simple code made in python using the MyMemory API to translate phrases in a .txt file.

MyMemory API is free but free and anonymous usage is limited to 5000 characters/day and Max 500 bytes using "q" parameter
and the phrase you want to translate must be in UTF-8 standard.

You can consult the API documentation at this Link: https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php

Inside the repository are the data used in the code as an example and the code made in Python 3.11.1

The code takes the data (phrases) inside the generica.txt file that are in English and translates it into Brazilian Portuguese,
saving the new translated phrases in a new file with the name manual_tradutor.txt.
